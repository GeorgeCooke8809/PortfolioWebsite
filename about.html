                <h1 class="Title">About Me</h1>
                <p> Hello, my name is George Cooke. I am currently a first year A-Level student  studying Computer Science, Maths, and Economics based in the UK. I didn't grow up in a particularly tech literate family. My father loves audio and has put hundreds of hours along with thousand of pounds into the various audio systems we have around the house but the process of setting it up is a most painful chore to him - he finds the magic in the result of listening to beautiful music from home as if he were sitting in a live crowd. I'm quite different, I love the process of setting up new technology and have done from a very young age.</p>

                <p>I can remember trying to find only bits of hardware like radios and TV remotes that we weren't using around the house anymore and taking them apart to try and figure out how they worked as a small child. I can't say I ever put them back together successfully but I was captivated by the magic of technology. As I got older and started getting technology for birthdays and Christmas, one of the best parts of the respective days would be running up to my room to setup the new things that I'd been given and messing around with them to test their limits and see what I could do.</p>
                
                <p>In Year 7 (aged 11), I took my first secondary school Computer Science lesson. While this was nothing like the GCSE and A-Level I would go on to do, it was a substantial step up from the IT lessons of primary school where we had one IT room among the whole school with aging computers and teachers that were as technologically illiterate as any of us. It was likely in Year 7 that I fell in love with software.</p>

                <p>I am currently most experienced in Python but am looking to broaden my horizons with C# and HTML/CSS/Javascript.</p>

                <p>This is where I will be posting my development portfolio going forward. I will confess this might as well be my first time using HTML so you will have to forgive me if it is a little rudimentary. Make sure to keep checking back to check on my progress!
